In this demo, we look at how well we can identify accessibility issues
related to positioning of content. In this case we concentrate on
cookie notices and language switchers. The issues we are looking for
fall into section 5.2.4 of WCAG, generally called "accessibility supported"
that deals with conformance claims. 5.2.4 in a nutshell says that even
if all the the WCAG Success Citeria have been met, a webiste does not
conform to WCAG if it does nto support regular assistive technology.
That is usually taken to mean screen-readers and screen magnifiers as
a bare minimum.

If important and/or legally necessary content is not easily findable 
because of design descisions that impact assistve technology, a site
is deened to have failed conformance (amd by inferance, legislation that
mandates conformance).

The prompt provides the source code of the inaccessibilityMatters website 
and a screenshot of the rendered page, and we ask first for detection
of both elements. 

For those that are found, we ask how many tab presses
it takes from the top of the page to reach them. This is important from
a usability perspective (how hard is it to reach content?) but also from
an accessibility one as we don't want the user to interact with content 
that modifies cookies before they are aware the site uses them. Cookie 
notices at the end of the HTML body will not be found easily by screen-reader 
users without additional programming effort by the developers. A similar
issue affects language switchers: if they are hard to find, then a user 
may be forced to navugat a page in a language they don not know looking
for that switcher.

Additionally, users on high magnification of 400% and up, need to know
that there is a cookie notice easily, and if they need to scroll down the
page to discover it, again they may again interact with cookie modifying 
content before discovering the notice.

Wehen we look at the response from Claude, we find that the accessibilitMatters
page contains both a cookie notice and a language switcher. The cookie notice
is at the bottom of the page, and is not considered visible at 400% magnifiaction
with the magnifier at the top of the page. This claim is from Claude, and further
investigation is needed to discover what tests it used to come to this conclusion.

Three sets of resonses are provided in the response.txt file, with Claude
set to different levels token user and temperature (how creative it can be).
Both give similar results, the second, with more tokens and creativity provides
a more detailed response. The thirs set have Claude access only to the source
code.

Looking at the second response, Claude identifies the explicit tab order 
on the page followed byt he user tabbing to the cookie notice, identify the
interactive elemets as it goes. It requres eight tabs to reach the accept button
of the notice.

Claude identifies additional issues with the language switcher that stop it
being bale to return a tab count for the switcher. The switcher is aria-hidden
and with a role of presentation (a mis-spelled "role" ttribute as it explains)
and correcty identifies the language switcher as being keyboard unreachable.

Consequently, we have identifed conformace issues (WCAG 5.2.4) with positioning
of content for both screenr-reader and screen-magnifier, but also, in passing,
syntax and grammar issues with the source code that are part of WCAG 4.1.2
Name, Role, Value (level AA).

So, how much of this work is dependent in any way on the screenshot and how 
much is algorihmic? The answer from ressponse set 3 is that Claude used the
screenshot to understand the relative size of content. Without the screenshot
it was not able to decide whether the cookie notice could be seen by a screen
magnifier user at 400% without vertical scrolling:

"Based on the provided styles, the cookie notice has a fixed position at the 
bottom of the page with a white background color and small font size. However, 
without seeing the rendered page, it's difficult to determine if a 
screen-magnifier user at 400% or greater magnification would be aware of it 
without scrolling."
