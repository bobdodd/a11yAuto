The goal of this demo is to show AI testing a page for WCAG success criteria
3.1.1 Language of Page (level A) and 3.1.2 Language of Parts (level AA). We
concentrate of language detection from the actual text rather than on the syntax 
of the lang attributes, going beyond the classic automated testing 
currently available.

The prompt queries the embedded HTML of a web pge. That HTML is, in this case,
copied by insoecting the rendered web page using the Chrome dev tools and
copying the element.

We use Claude's HTML knowledge to identify the text content of the page and 
identify the dominant language of this text. On this page, that is English.

We ask Claude to comapre this with the delared language of the page, which is
"fr".

We also ask Claude to identify any words that are not in the dominant language,
It sould find some French and Spanish in the language switcher.

For any words that are not in the dominant language, we ask if they are wrapped
in lang attributes appropriate to their language. In this case they are not.
