Based on the textContent of the elements, the dominant language of the HTML page appears to be English. 
However, this does not match the language defined for the page in the HTML tag, which is set to "fr" (French).

There are a few words and phrases that are not in English:

1. "Español" in the language switcher
2. "Français" in the language switcher

These non-English words do not have the required `lang` attribute applied to them. 
To properly indicate the language of these words, you should wrap them in an appropriate element 
(e.g., `<span>`) and add the `lang` attribute with the corresponding language code. For example:

```html
<a href="#"><span lang="es">Español</span></a>
<a href="#"><span lang="fr">Français</span></a>
```

By adding the `lang` attribute, you provide a clear indication of the language used 
for those specific words, which is important for accessibility and proper language identification.
